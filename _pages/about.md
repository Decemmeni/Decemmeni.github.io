Welcome! I am Jordan, currently a freshman in college, who is very dedicated in tech. At home, I love to play video games with friends, design video games with the Godot game engine, and randomly dive into learning anything technology related, such as video game modding, algorithms for data, or artificial intelligence. You can check out my personal works in the portfolio section of my website!
