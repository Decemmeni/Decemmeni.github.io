Ever since I was a child, I have been obsessed with video games.  I have played all genres of video games, but one that stood out to me was the Metroidvania genres. Hollow Knight, Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps, Grime, etc. I absolutely love the idea of adventuring and getting stuck to realize you missed something detrimental to pass. Now why does this matter? Well that because my dream game is a Metroidvania! During my Junior year of High School, I found the perfect game engine to create my dream game, and started my creation. You are a lone swordsman who woke up in the middle of an island, with the goal set in mind to become the strongest swordsman in all of reality. You heard rumors of the fabled "Gladiscenderem", the sword that transcends reality, and you're keen on getting it. In your journeys, you face the strongest of enemies, face the roughest dilemmas that can influence the future, and forge new powerful blades. The gods have seen you as a unstable entity and consider you a threat.

You can check out the development on my youtube channel, same github name.
